# E-portfolio Clean Code
This is a little web API (actually there are two) with Python Flask for a E-Portfolio which I had to do for my University.

I choose python because I know it pretty well and python code tends to be a mess pretty fast. So it is good to show that you can change something if someone uses Clean Code.

I didn't use every pattern and the usage of these patterns depend on the special case. You should know when to write Clean Code. It is not always better espacially if you want high performance applications or systems.
